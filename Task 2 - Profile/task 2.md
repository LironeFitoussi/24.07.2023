Profile Project

Create a new project named "Profile" and work within it.

1. Create a profile page for a celeb character:

2. In the top part, create a header with a height of 10% of the screen, in blue color with white text that displays your name.

3. In the bottom part, create a footer with a height of 13% of the screen, in black color with red text that displays your email address.

4. The design of the header and footer should be applied using an external style sheet.

5. Create a section between them and work inside it.

6. Give a background color of pink to the section using inline styling.

7. Add an image of the character with a size of 50 by 50 pixels. Provide the styling using an external style sheet.

8. Below the image, create a heading with the character's name, in red color and with a shadow, using an external style sheet.

9. Below the heading, create an article with 5 paragraphs (they don't need to contain real information).

10. Paragraphs 1, 3, and 5 should have a background color of orange, and the rest should be in yellow, using an external style sheet.

11. Below the image, add a link to the character's Wikipedia page and style it to appear as regular green text using an external style sheet.
